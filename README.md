1. Landing page with links to Github, LinkedIn, Google. Uses UI gradients for stylings. React-MDL navbar.
   Page also gives a timed notice telling the userwhat the optimal zoom is for page format.

2. The second page is a basic about me page. It uses reusable components to easily add more information 
   about my education and work experience.
   
3. The third page has schedule component. You can switch between four different semester schedules using
   designated buttons. The schedule takes in data from a json file, class panels are assigned random rgb 
   values to make them easy to distinguish.
   
4. The fourth page is an experiments page which utilizes react-spring to try different component transitions
   and animations. While all of the experiments worked on my local machine, most of them don't seem to work 
   or render on the deployed version. The only working component on this page is a smooth and reactive draggable list.
   
Ignore broken heroku deployment...
